# ðŸŽ² Dice Game â€” A Two-Player Dice Game in JavaScript

A simple, fun, and interactive dice game for two players, built with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project was created as a pet project to practice DOM manipulation, game logic, and UI design.

## ðŸŽ® Game Rules

- Two players take turns to roll a dice.
- Each roll (except 1) adds the number to the player's **current score**.
- If the player rolls a **1**, their current score resets and it's the other player's turn.
- A player can **"Hold"** their score to add it to their **total score**.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.
